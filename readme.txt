== Description ==

How to take this plugin into use: 

1. Include all the necessary taxonomies in the subscription form (templates/tk-notifications-ajax-form-layout.php). 

2. Update tk_notifications_ajax_public_handler() in tk-notifications.php to take care of any custom taxonomies that you are using in the subscription form. 

3. When a new post is published the plugin runs tk_notifications_read_post_categories_tags( $ID, $post ) in tk-notifications.php. Update the function to get the terms of your custom taxonomies. Push all the taxonomies to $post_taxonomies.
